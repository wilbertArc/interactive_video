            <p>Classes finally ended, and as you stepped out of school, the weight of your unfinished project pressed gently on your shoulders—not crushing yet, but persistent, like a reminder tapping at the back of your mind.</p>
            <p>You got home, dropped your bag, and walked straight into the kitchen.</p>
            <p>There was food to cook—nothing fancy, just enough to fuel your brain for the work ahead. You opened the fridge, saw the ingredients, and stood there for a moment.</p>
            <p>Then the thought hit you: why not just order something?</p>
            <p>Within minutes, you had your phone in hand and McDelivery on the way. Fries, a burger, a soda. Cheap, fast, familiar comfort.</p>
            <p>You told yourself it would save time. When the food arrived, the smell was so inviting that you sat on the couch while eating. Your friend called you, feel bored. You guys turned on the laptop. The game just standing there in your desktop.</p>
            <p>You gave in.</p>
            <p>You told yourself you'd only play a little while. A short break before getting serious.</p>
            <p>But the matches were fun. The laughter with your friends felt good. The hours slipped by unnoticed, one round bleeding into the next.</p>
            <p>Your stomach grew heavier with each bite, your body lazier with each win. The food didn't energize you—it slowed you down. And the project? Completely forgotten.</p>
            <p>When you finally glanced at the time, it was past midnight.</p>
            <p>You hadn't written a single word. You hadn't even opened the document.</p>
            <p>You sat there, a half-empty drink beside you, a cold wrapper on your lap, and a wave of discomfort in your chest—not just from the food, but from the choices you made.</p>
            <p>The next morning was worse. You woke up groggy, sluggish, and full of regret. No progress. No plan. No excuse.</p>
            <p>You carried that feeling with you into school—the quiet dread of knowing you had time… and wasted it.</p>
