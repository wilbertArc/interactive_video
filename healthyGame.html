            <p>The school day ended with one thing on your mind: the project.</p>
            <p>It had been on your to-do list all week, but life kept getting in the way. Still, tonight felt different. You were determined to handle it.</p>
            <p>When you got home, the hunger hit immediately.</p>
            <p>You glanced at the food delivery apps on your phone but shook your head. Not this time.</p>
            <p>You walked into the kitchen, pulled out ingredients, and began to cook.</p>
            <p>Simple. Fresh. Nothing fancy, but enough to make you feel grounded. As you sat down to eat, a sense of control settled in. You were off to a good start.</p>
            <p>Just as you finished cleaning up, your phone buzzed.<br>
            It was your friend, asking what you wanted to do tonight.</p>
            <p>You hesitated.</p>
            <p>You could dive straight into the project. Or… relax a bit and play games first.</p>
            <p>You told yourself you'd only play for an hour—just enough to unwind.</p>
            <p>The laughter with your friends, the glow of the screen, the thrill of the game—it pulled you in. Time, as always, passed faster than expected. By the time you checked the clock, it was already late.</p>
            <p>The project? Still untouched.</p>
            <p><You considered opening the file. But your eyes were heavy, your focus slipping. You told yourself you'd wake up early and do it first thing in the morning.</p>
            <p>The next day, you woke up surprisingly refreshed.</p>
            <p>Cooking a real meal the night before helped more than you expected. Your body felt awake, your mind sharp. But the guilt sat quietly in your chest—last night had been a missed opportunity.</p>
            <p>Still, you didn’t waste time.</p>
            <p>You sat at your desk, opened your laptop, and began typing.</p>
            <p>The ideas flowed. It wasn’t perfect, and you were on the clock—but you were moving. You were trying.</p>
            <p><And that mattered.</p>
            <p class="ending">THE END</p>
