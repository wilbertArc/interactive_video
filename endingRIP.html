            <p>The moment you stepped through the front door, the weight of the day hit you.</p>
            <p>Class had been long. You were mentally drained. But tonight was supposed to be your comeback—your chance to finally get that project done before the deadline.</p>
            <p>You tossed your bag onto your bed and opened your laptop. The screen glowed with a blank document and a blinking cursor.</p>
            <p>You glanced at the clock. 3:45 PM. Plenty of time.</p>
            <p>Your stomach growled. Right—food first.</p>
            <p>You walked into the kitchen and opened the fridge. Chicken, rice, some vegetables. You could make something. Nothing fancy—just fuel. But the thought of chopping, stirring, washing dishes... it was already tiring.</p>
            <p>You slowly closed the fridge.</p>
            <p>Then your eyes caught the notification of your phone. “I’ll just check the delivery apps...” you told yourself.</p>
            <p>Swipe. Tap. McDonald's. Cheeseburger. Fries. Coke. Maybe a McFlurry.</p>
            <p>It was too easy.</p>
            <p>By 4:30 PM, your food had arrived. You sat on the chair, just for a minute while eating.</p>
            <p>The fries were still hot. The burger hit just right. The soda gave a refreshing fizz as you scrolled on your phone.</p>
            <p>5:47 PM.</p>
            <p>You got a call from a friend inviting to fight the boredom together.</p>
            <p>You sat at your desk, opened the project... and stared at the screen.</p>
            <p>Your stomach felt heavy. Your brain, slow.</p> 
            <p>You blinked hard. You yawned. The room felt warm, cozy—maybe a little too cozy.</p>
            <p>You managed to type a sentence. Then another. You erased one. Rewrote it.</p>
            <p>You leaned your head on your hand… just for a second…</p>
            <p>You wake up to sunlight.</p>
            <p>Your neck aches. Your laptop is still open. You check the time: 7:22 AM. The deadline was midnight.</p>

            <p>You scroll up.</p>
            <p>Unfinished.</p>
            <p>Your heart sinks. You feel the pit in your stomach—not from hunger, but from regret.</p>
