            <p>The final bell rang, and class was over.</p>
            <p>The project still lingered at the front of your mind—due soon, and important. You weren't behind, but you knew that putting it off would only make tomorrow harder.</p>
            <p>When you got home, your stomach growled. You thought briefly about ordering out, but something in you shifted. Instead, you stepped into the kitchen and cooked a simple, warm meal. The kind that made you feel taken care of—even if you were the one doing the caring.</p>
            <p>After dinner, your phone buzzed. A call from a friend. He is waiting for you. The temptation was there.</p>
            <p>But you glanced at your laptop and saw the project folder sitting open.</p>
            <p>This time, you chose focus over fun. You sat down and started writing. At first, slowly—but then with flow. Your ideas took shape, your paragraphs built on each other, and soon you were in the zone.</p>
            <p>No distractions. No pressure. Just progress. You finished earlier than expected, closed your laptop, and felt a sense of peace settle over you. You had done what needed to be done—and it felt good.</p>
            <p>You went to bed without stress. No panic. No guilt. The next morning, sunlight poured into your room.</p>
            <p>You woke up refreshed, body light, and mind clear. You smiled to yourself—no scrambling, no dread. Just calm, confidence, and a quiet sense of pride.</p>
            <p>Every small decision you make builds the future you wake up in.</p>
            <p>Discipline may feel hard in the moment—but peace, pride, and freedom are waiting on the other side. Keep choosing what matters most. You've got this.</p>
           
            <p class="game-over">WELL DONE</p>
